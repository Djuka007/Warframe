        <p>Warframe is a free-to-play action role-playing third-person shooter multiplayer
             online game developed and published by Digital Extremes. First released for Windows
              personal computers in March 2013, it was later ported to PlayStation 4 in November
               2013, Xbox One in September 2014, Nintendo Switch in November 2018, PlayStation 5 
               in November 2020, and Xbox Series X/S in April 2021. Support for cross-platform play was
                released in 2022. Cross-save, as well as ports to mobile devices, is planned for 2023.

        <p>In Warframe, players control members of the Tenno, 
            a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of suspended
             animation far into Earth's future to find themselves at war in the planetary 
             system with different factions. The Tenno use their powered Warframes along with a 
             variety of weapons and abilities to complete missions. While many of the game's missions 
             use procedurally-generated levels, it also includes large open world areas similar to other
              massively multiplayer online games, as well as some story-specific missions with fixed level
               design. The game includes elements of shooting and melee games, parkour, and role-playing to
                allow players to advance their Tenno with improved gear. The game includes both player versus
                 environment and player versus player elements. It is supported by microtransactions, which 
                 lets players purchase in-game items using real money, but also offers the option to earn them
                  at no cost through grinding.</p>
