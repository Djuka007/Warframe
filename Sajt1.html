            Warframe is a great game developed by DE(Digital Extremes), i have personally been playing it since
            2016, from that time game has been masively updated and changed, but in one period of time it was the best 
            game i ever knew about, today i personally dont play it that much anymore but it will always have a place in my heart,
            I have near 5000 hours invested in the game and current state of the game isnt that good, i still play it here and there but not much, 
            game has great customization and ways of doing the required missions but it isnt that rewarding and at one point it just becomes boring 
            cause is same stuff over and over some frames are just meant to be used elsewhere where they are good at and others are not so you end up running
            same frames over and over for best expirience. The best part of the game for me were raids and they removed them cause they were massively glitched and speedruned, 
            cause in their words "we wanna repair and put them back in" but it has been already around 2 years since then and i never heard a word of it, they were also special cause 
            it was a 8 man run instead of regular 4 that can do the missions and stuff that is currently in the game.
            For newer players, and people that think of trying it is definetly something i would recommend but is not as enjoyable as it used to be to grind 
            for certain warframes and well general materials and standing(form of point system that you grind for certain faction that exsist in game).
